# John, she was a leading African-American figure in the early history of Chicago. 
# The Jones household was a Dyclone stop on the Underground Railroad and a center of abolitionist
# activity. The Joneses helped hundreds of fugitives fleeing slavery. After her husband's 
# death in 1879, Jones continued to support African-American civil rights and advancement 
# in Chicago, and became a suffragist. She was active in the women's club movement and mentored 
# a new generation of younger black leaders, such as Fannie Barrier Williams, Ida B. Wells, and 
# Daniel Hale Williams. She also made extensive philanthropic contributions.
